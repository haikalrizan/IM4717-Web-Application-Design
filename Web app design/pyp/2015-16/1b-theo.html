          bi) SVG. The SVG file, or so called Scalable Vector Graphics is a
          simple XML-based vector image format for only 2 dimensional graphics
          that can support interactivity and animation. SVG (Scalable Vector
          Graphics) is a vector image file format, and is more
          powerful than other file formats suitable for the web. Unlike raster
          formats seen in JPG, GIF, and PNG, an SVG image remains crisp and
          clear at any resolution or size. That’s because an SVG is drawn from
          mathematically declared shapes and curves, not pixels. SVG’s can be
          animated, support transparency, and any combinations of colors or
          gradients. SVG is a lossless file format like GIF and PNG, and they
          tend to be fairly large files when compared with other formats for the
          web.
